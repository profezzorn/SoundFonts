This is the default SD card contents for ProffieOS / TeensySaber.

Please see readme and license files in each directory for more information.

To use these files, grab a blank SD card and format it as FAT32.
For best results, use this tool for formatting as opposed to the built-in disk utility:
https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/

Then copy all the files from this zip file onto the SD card. The top-level
directory of the SD card should contain this file, tracks, TeensySF, etc.
