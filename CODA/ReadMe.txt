Shards of ice cut into your cheeks and you hear footsteps crunching in the snow 
towards you. You turn your head to see heavy black boots and a cape blowing in 
the wind. Through a helmet, a voice calls out as the footsteps come closer. 
"You've been quite the problem for me, but I can't deny the grandness of our 
story so far. It's like a symphony. As much as I've enjoyed the back and forth, 
it's time for the final movement." A lightsaber blade crackles to life next to 
your face, but as the black figure swings, you kick out their legs and pull your 
own lightsaber hilt to their heart. "Wrong again. This is the coda."
