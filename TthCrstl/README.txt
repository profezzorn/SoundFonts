Light Side soundfont created specifically tuned for the TeensySaber lightsaber operating system created by Fredrik Hubinette (http://fredrik.hubbe.net/lightsaber/teensy_saber.html) and specifically designed for the "Smooth Swing v2" algorithm developed by Thexter (http://therebelarmory.com/user/2475)

This font was created using a collection of sounds I personally recorded (local electric substation, 9mm pistol ricochet off a 1/2" steel plate at 25 yds, slinkies, ceiling fan with a t-shirt hanging from it, car battery electrical arcing from jumper cables) as well as a NASA shuttle launch audio of the Discovery space shuttle which was public domain.

All Fx and mixdowns/mastering done primarily in Reaper (http://www.reaper.fm) with some single-track modifications done in Audacity.

Modification by Brian Conner 2022.
Hum volume normalized to -5dB to bring mix balance more inline with most other fonts.
font.wav generated from FreeTTS and processed.
