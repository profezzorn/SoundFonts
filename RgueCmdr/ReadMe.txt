bgnlock: Created from existing lock and additional sounds.

lock: Edited to loop cleaner. Edited lock to have less monophonic-like hum mixed in and added some electrical arcing.

hum: Normalized hum to -5db. This is in lieu of editing config.ini volHum parameter, as (initially) config.ini didn't exist. 
Better mix balance now and falls in line with the majority of other font levels.

out: normalized to 0dB, full fade out at end.

clsh files: Removed excess silences and normalized to 0dB.
