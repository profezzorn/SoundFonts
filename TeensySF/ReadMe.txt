Hierarchy made to be FAT32 friendly.

clsh10.wav's end faded out so as to not end so abruptly.

humstart adjusted to 1800, leaving ~100ms initial "punch" of out wav clear.

Smoothswing pair 1 was over-modulated and distorted. Removed and left remaining 7 pairs.

config.ini and smoothsw.ini updated.
- Relevant parameters added.
- Links to Wiki Pages for .ini files added.
